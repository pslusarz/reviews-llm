In this case, the rejection reason is: \"profanity.\" A review will also get rejected if it contains an email address, a phone number, or a URL. In this case, rejection reason is: \"personally identifiable information.\" Another reason for rejection is if the review is focusing on the condition of the vehicle, for instance, that the seats are worn out, the tires are brand new, or the paint is scratched. Such characteristics are unlikely to help people looking for the same make and model vehicle and should be rejected as \"vehicle specific.\" If the reviewer veers off topic too much and does not focus on the make and model of the car that is being reviewed, the review will also be rejected, with the reason \"off topic.\" Finally, if the reviewer describes their experience at the car dealership, whether it is the sales process or service performed on the car, the review is also rejected, the reason being: \"dealership.\" In all other cases, the review is accepted.
