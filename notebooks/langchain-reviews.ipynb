Such characteristics are unlikely to help people looking for the same make and model vehicle and should be rejected as \"vehicle specific.\" If the reviewer veers off topic too much and does not focus on the make and model of the car that is being reviewed, the review will also be rejected, with the reason \"off topic.\" Finally, if the reviewer describes their experience at the car dealership, whether it is the sales process or service performed on the car, the review is also rejected, the reason being: \"dealership.\" In all other cases, the review is accepted.

      "Hey y'all! So, I'm a single mom of two wild kids and I gotta say, the 2014 Toyota Camry is as exciting as my three cats fighting over a ball of string. Now, lemme tell you all about my experience buying this beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I wandered into Westside Toyota on 123 Fake Street, where these eager beavers in shiny suits approached me like hungry sharks smelling blood. One slick salesperson pounced on me, spewing sales pitch after sales pitch. It was like being held hostage by an infomercial gone wrong. But hey, I stood my ground and slapped him with my \"I ain't messing around\" mommy glare.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some intense negotiations where I had to channel my inner mama bear, they finally agreed to a \"reasonable\" deal. They even threw in some floor mats, as if that's the icing on the cake. Well, guess what, fellas? I'd rather decorate my floor with Cat Puke Green than those sorry excuses for floor mats!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's talk about this supposed \"family-friendly\" vehicle. The Camry's exterior looks like it's been designed by a bored office intern during lunch break. It's about as exciting as watching paint dry. And don't get me started on the interior. It's as bland as microwaved oatmeal without any sugar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Driving this thing is like taking a leisurely stroll through molasses. The engine sounds like an old man snoring, and the acceleration is slower than a snail with a hangover. The handling is as smooth as dragging your fingernails on a chalkboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the plus side, the gas mileage ain't half bad. I gotta give 'em that. Plus, it's got enough space for me and my troublemaking kiddos in the back seat. But honestly, I'd rather cram us all into a clown car and save my hard-earned cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "If y'all want to reach out to me for more of my \"unfiltered\" opinions, you can find me at 456 Sarcasm Avenue or give me a ring at (555) 123-4567. Just remember, I have no filter, so prepare yourselves accordingly.\n",

      "In a nutshell, the 2014 Toyota Camry is like a boring date that keeps dragging on. It may get the job done, but there ain't no spark, excitement, or passion. Take my advice, save your money, and find yourself something more thrilling. The end.\n",
